Prerequistic:
install neo4j desktop or use the cloud version and it should contain the database_name, user and password 
Modify the content with your own 


To run the code:
run main.py ----> python main.py (in terminal)

and populate the neo4j database using the fastapi api endpoints or use cypher query 

And open index.html file you can use it 
this is just the version 1 of the problem
